# Project: The N-Queens Problem

This repository contains the source code for Group 22's implementation
of the N-Queens Problem project in the Intelligent Systems Programming course,
a second-semester course of the Software Development - Design Track - Master at ITU.

## Getting Started

The Queens.java is the main class that parses command line parameters and initializes the n-queens problem.
To run the program you can for example type 'java Queens Queen22 5' in the terminal or go to the Queens class documentation
for the details.

The above commands set our group's implementation to place the queens in an ideal solution after you choose one or two placements on the board, our Queen22 is a configurator class that finds the optimal solution for the problem.
